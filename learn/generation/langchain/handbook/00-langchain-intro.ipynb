        "\n",
        "LangChain is a popular framework that allow users to quickly build apps and pipelines around **L**arge **L**anguage **M**odels. It can be used to for chatbots, **G**enerative **Q**uestion-**A**nwering (GQA), summarization, and much more.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core idea of the library is that we can _\"chain\"_ together different components to create more advanced use-cases around LLMs. Chains may consist of multiple components from several modules:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Prompt templates**: Prompt templates are, well, templates for different types of prompts. Like \"chatbot\" style templates, ELI5 question-answering, etc\n",
        "\n",
        "* **LLMs**: Large language models like GPT-3, BLOOM, etc\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Agents**: Agents use LLMs to decide what actions should be taken, tools like web search or calculators can be used, and all packaged into logical loop of operations.\n",

In other words, it is a method of teaching a computer to learn by example, rather than through explicit instructions.\\n\\nMachine learning algorithms are used to find patterns and relationships in data, and to make predictions or decisions based on those patterns. They are used in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, fraud detection, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.\\n\\nThere are several types of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is the most common type and involves training a model on labeled data, where the correct answer is provided for each example. Unsupervised learning is used when the data is not labeled and the goal is to find patterns or structure in the data. Reinforcement learning is a type of learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.\\n\\nMachine learning is a rapidly growing field, with many exciting applications and potential uses. As the amount of data generated by the world continues to increase, machine learning is becoming increasingly important for making sense of that data and making informed decisions.'"
